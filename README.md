# The Survival Guide to working with us

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/neuropsychology/Onboarding?label=last%20update)

**Welcome to the team!** 🎉 Whether you're a student, an intern or a colleague, joining a new work environment can be a bit stressful. In order to ease your first days and set you up for the future, we compiled this guide and hope that you will find it useful (though keep in mind that it's in a work-in-progress state).

The goal of this document is first and foremost to help you acquire the **same frame of reference**, so you can then understand what we are talking about, the issues that we face and the solutions that we find. However, it is possible that some of the advice or things here might at first seem weird or useless. **Trust us though, it will <sup><sub>*probably*</sub></sup> become handy some day** 😉

This guide has been crafted by all **past and current members of the team**. It's our collective legacy, and it will be yours too. As such, by the end of your journey here, we hope that you will leave your mark in this document, by updating / improving / revising some of its content. Don't worry, you will see *how* to do that later.

## Our vision

Our team in centered around core values such as close **teamwork**, continuous **learning**, **friendly** environment and **aiming for new heights**.

We rely on a lot of internal **communication** (about stuff more - or less - related to work :grin:), our ability to keep on learning and improving, a cool working environment (forget the formalities, ain't nobody got time for that!) and striving for the highest standards in terms of sciencific quality and honesty. We're strongly committed to **open-science**, i.e., working open by sharing our code, documentation, data and expertise.

On a more abstract level, I believe in what I call the **three-fold neuropsychology skill set**. In short, I think that a neuropsychologist (and, by extension, people working on-related topics - which is sort of all that we do) should aim (when applicable) at developping 3 types of expertise: **clinical abilities** (neuro/psychopathology, assessment, therapy & rehabilitation, ...), **technical skills**  (statistics, programming, neuroimaging, signal processsing, ...) and **theoretical knowledge** (a diversified knowledge and understanding of the psychological and neuroscientific theories, frameworks and their history). This means I expect you to become familiar. Of course, some of it (typically, clinical skills) might not be feasible given the project / grade you're in. That's okay, we will help you to make a plan for your future to get as close as you can to your objectives.

## Work Schedule and Work-life Balance

We value and believe in individuality. Everybody has their own prefered organization and other life prerogatives. Some are night owlers and others are early birds, some have day hobbies and others night passions; some have other people to take care of (children, parents, ...) and some have themselves (which can be a lot). We should not expect each others to work regularly from 9-5 everyday, or to be available at all times. **I will sometimes send emails on the evening or on the weekends**, because that's how I work. That does **not** mean you should check or reply immediately: do work when you decide to and aim for a varied lifestyle. If by any chance something is super urgent, I'll make it explicit by preempting the message with [URGENT] (but it never happened so far).

## Questions & Answers

> **I'm not sure what I should do and what my tasks are / I feel kinda lost**

Send us a message and let us know, we're likely unaware of that!

> **There's too much work for me** or **There's not enough work for me**

Send us a message and let us know, we're likely unaware of that!

In summary, for any reason, **do not hestitate to drop us a message!** Communication is key. Otherwise any unadressed issue can build up and create unnecessary stress or problems.

> **I sent a message but nobody answered...**

Don't hesitate to send us a **reminder** (after a reasonable time). There's usually a lot going on so it happens that we miss or skip things. It's not against you, and we'll be thankful that you reminded us.


## Reality Bending

For those joining the **Reality Bending Lab** (REBEL), we recommend reading a few posts to better understand the team's scope and history:

- [Rebel research themes](https://realitybending.github.io/research/)
- [REBEL logo symbolism]([https://realitybending.github.io/post/2021-06-30-logo_meaning/](https://realitybending.github.io/post/2023-02-01-new_logo/))
- [What is reality bending](https://realitybending.github.io/post/2020-09-28-what_is_realitybending/)
- [Affective Reality Theory](https://realitybending.github.io/post/2023-04-11-affectivereality/)

<!-- ## Roadmap <sub>(updated 09-01-2023)</sub> -->


## 📆 Day 1: Enter the world

### 1. Explore your environment

Alright, here's the big day! First, take the time to settle in your space. Pay a visit to your colleagues, introduce yourself, explore the building, locate the offices, find the toilets and the coffee machine.

### 2. Get the Admin done

Do whatever is required on the admin side, complete the ethical certification, the mandatory trainings, etc.

- [ ] Ethics Certification (on ethics and integrity in research)
- [ ] University mandatory courses (if you are an employee)

### 3. Get connected

It might not be good news if you're an introvert that prefers to stay anonymous on the internet, but doing research at our lab will require you to build a public persona and engage openly with the world of research.

#### 🗣️ **Discord**

We use Discord as an internal communication channel. Do ask for the invite link if you don't receive one.


#### 🐦 **Twitter**

We believe that the best way to start this journey is to get out there, listen to the ongoing discourses and get publicly engaged. And [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/home) is a good platform to do it 😉 Many researchers use it to share and summarize their new studies and projects, recruit participants or advertise positions. So you can easily keep up with the latest scientific news here. If you don't believe us, check-out this [**book about Twitter for researchers**](https://t4scientists.com/).

After creating an account, you can start by your **colleagues**:

- [@RealityBending_](https://twitter.com/RealityBending_)
- [@Dom_Makowski](https://twitter.com/Dom_Makowski)
- **ADD YOURSELF**

We have compiled a list of interesting accounts, covering all sorts of different topics (but always somewhat relevant to what we do). You can follow this **list** and **pin it** to quickly access it from your timeline (don't forget to make suggestions to update this list). You can then start following yourself the people that you like.

- **Reality Bending Twitter List**: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1509796111724134401

At first, you'll likely have to force yourself a bit to open and check twitter from time to time (to make it easier, set it as favourite tab and download the app). It's normal. But don't worry, once their machine learning algorithm gets a grip of what you like, it will start to be filled with interesting content.

#### 👨‍🔬 **ResearchGate**

[**ResearchGate**](https://researchgate.com/home) is a professional networking site for scientists and researchers to share, discover and discuss research. (It's like a researchers' version of *LinkedIn*). You can see what kinds of projects others are currently working on, and their past manuscripts and publications. You can also **access articles**, post and answer questions, as well as recommend certain works! So do create an account and start following us and the researchers you like. I will add you to the [Lab page](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Reality-Bending-Lab-ReBeL-Dominique-Makowski).


#### :octocat: **GitHub**

The last app that we use, and probably the most important, is GitHub. Whether you're a beginner to programming or an expert, integrating into this community means you'll be constantly learning. GitHub is a place where projects are shared openly and transparently, and you can simply *watch* any repository you're interested in to receive notifications of relevant updates.

- You can start by reading this post: [Why psychologists should join GitHub](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/2020-05-27-github_psychologists/)

We are using GitHub for ***a lot*** of stuff (like pretty much for everything, storing data, writing papers, projects, ...), and therefore you'll need to become familiar with it. First off, let's start with 1) Creating an account for you (*advice: use a simple login like FirstnameSurname rather than something you might regret later* 😬), 2) Watch [this repo](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Onboarding) (by selecting *Watching* on the watch button in the top-right corner) so you'll get notified of updates, 3) star 🌟 it and 4) start using it as follows:

  1. Create a new issue in [this repo](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Onboarding/issues)
  2. Select the **Introduce myself** template
  3. Answer the questions
  4. post it (we'll close it afterwards)
  5. **Follow us** (hit the follow button on the top right corner):
  - [@RealityBending](https://github.com/RealityBending)
  - [@DominiqueMakowski](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski)
  - **ADD YOURSELF**

## 📆 Day 2: Get familiar with the workflow


### Create your first Github Pull Requests (PR)

As said earlier, **we use GitHub a lot**, so it's key that you acquire this complicated skill. However, it's quite tricky to get familiar and comfortable with it (even we struggle sometimes), and I'd say it's one of the most complicated thing you'll have to learn. But you cannot learn if you don't try, break things and succeed.


1. **Create your own first repo**

Now, create your first repository! You can leave it mostly empty for now, it's just an experiment ground :relaxed: We recommend starting with a README page that will serve as your profile page.

- **To Read**: [Creating and customizing your profile README page](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme
)

2. **Make a PR in this document here**

The first task is to create a Pull Request (PR) to modify *this very page*. Go to the [README page](https://github.com/RealityBending/Onboarding/blob/master/README.md) file and hit the "Fork and edit" button (the pen icon at the top right corner). Under the hoold, this will create a fork of the Onboarding account under your repo. You can then edit the file. **For example, you can add *your* twitter and GitHub handle in the "lab members" list in the sections above** (above the "You" placeholder). Then, propose the change and see what happens.

- **To Read**: [markdown introduction](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)


3. **Setting up your profile on the REBEL website**

The next task is to set-up your profile on the [lab website](https://realitybending.github.io/people/).

- **Step 1: Fork the website repository**
    - Go to the [Github Repository of website](https://github.com/RealityBending/RealityBending.github.io)
    - Hit the **fork** button at the top right corner to make a *copy* of the repository in your Github account.
    - After a few minutes of waiting, you should now see a repository with a name of `your-username/RealityBending.github.io`.

- **Step 2: Understand how a profile is made**
    - In your newly *copied* repository, navigate to the folder `your-username/RealityBending.github.io/content`. This is where all the content of the website is stored.
    - Click on the `people` folder. As you can see, each member has a folder (in lower case with a hyphen instead of spaces).
    - Explore one of these folder, for instance Gandalf's. It includes two files, *_index.md* file (The extension *.md* stands for **markdown**) and an image file named `avatar`.
    - Click on the .md file, and then on the **raw** button (on the right) to see the raw file (as a notepad would see).
    - The index file contains all the information, and is organized into a YAML header (delimited by 3 dashes ---) and then some text.


- **Step 3: Add your profile to the website**

    - Now that you understood how a profile is made, create on your computer a folder named `firstname-surname` (replace accordingly).
    - In this folder, put your profile pic and name it `avatar`.
    - Create a new text file named `_index` and replace the extension so that it's `.md` instead of `.txt` (google how to see file extensions if you're on windows and don't have it activated).
    - Open it with any raw text editor like notebook or RStudio or VScode (but not Word!).
    - Replace the text for something that applies to you.

- **Step 4: Commit to your fork**

    - On the `your-username/RealityBending.github.io/contentauthors/` page, you should click on **Add file** (on the right) and then **Upload files**.
    - Drag and drop your folder and click **"commit"**. You can add a commit message such as "Added my profile"/
    - You should see the folder that you just created at `https://github.com/your-username/RealityBending.github.io/tree/main/content/authors/MY-NEW-FOLDER`

- **Step 5: Make a Pull Request**

    - Great, you added the files to your own copy of the website. But now we need to merge these changes into the **original** repository.
    - Look for the *Pull Rquest* sign. Click on it.
    - The page will show that you are trying to make a Pull Request from **your** repositorty *"your-username/RealityBending.github.io"* to the **original** repository *RealityBending/RealityBending.github.io"*.
    - All the left for you to do is to click on that shiny green button to create the pull request (PR). Your profile will appear on the website as soon as an administrator validates the PR.

Congratulations! You have successfully updated your profile on our website!

Note that on GitHub (but also when writing research articles), we write in **markdown**, which is a set of conventions allowing to quickly and easily format text (e.g., text in bold, italic, titles, etc.).

## 📆 Day 3: Get familiar with the tools


### Python

We mostly use Python for signal processing and setting up experimental tasks. For instance, the [NeuroKit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit) project that we are working on is written in Python.
We also build our experimental tasks using [Neuropsydia.py](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Neuropsydia.py) which is also a Python module.

Therefore, it's important that you get familiar with the tool. Following are a few resources that we suggest to get you started:

- [Get familiar with Python in 10 minutes](https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/learn_python.html)


#### Setting-up Python


1. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or if you already have Winpython installed, simply open `VS Code.exe` from the winpy folder)
2. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Once VS Code is launched, the next step is to add new features and functionalities to support your development workflow. You can do so by installing these [extension packages](https://github.com/RealityBending/Onboarding/blob/master/vscode_settings.md#extensions) which you can find by clicking on this icon in the activity bar:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54053748/140497021-6dcfd265-2162-4262-801c-b0d74d704330.png)

4. Configure your workspace settings, using the following command: `Ctrl+Shift+P` and click on *Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)*. This opens your user `settings.json` where [the following configuration](https://github.com/RealityBending/Onboarding/blob/master/vscode_settings.md#settings) should be copied and pasted to (take note of the key path directories you will need to modify according to your machine!)
5. To start running some code, click *New File* and `Ctrl+S` to save the file into whichever directory in your computer you want, naming the file with a `.py` extension. Press `Shift+Enter` to send each line of code to an interactive window


### R

The bulk of our statistical analyses and manuscript preparation is done on R.

At this point, you might ask why can't we just stick to one programming language? What is the point of learning both R and Python?
The simple answer is that the two programming languages are basically different, and one can be better depending on the task.
Read this [**blog post** *(R or Python for Psychologists)*](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/r_or_python/) for a more in-depth discussion.

Following are a few resources to get you started with R:

- [**Introduction to R**](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction)
- **Help us!** Know some good ressources that helped you! Please share it with us

# Some Final Words

We encourage you to really explore and be integrated within the online scientific community along with us, as this will help you expand your knowledge and skillset as well as become better informed! It may be a steep learning curve initially, but we're here to help you along the way (we've been there ourselves!) and never hesitate to ask questions 😉
