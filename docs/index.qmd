## Supervision

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}

- Weekly lab meetings
  - Presence expected
  - Presentations
  - Occasion to touch base
  - Take notes during discussions
- Individual meetings and emails
- Group chat (discord)
  - Also for you among yourselves
  - memes friendly
- Send emails / messages whenever, but don’t expect an immediate answer
- Feedback style
  - Not a lot of positive reinforcement <sub><sup>*(I'm working on it)*</sup></sub>
  - A lot of corrections doesn't mean it's bad
  - I have a tendency to rewrite code
- Do always clean off track changes when sending a new version

## Be Collaborative

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.r-fit-text}

- Teamwork
  - Lab mates are your best resource
- Good grades are not at the expense of others
  - Helping others will be noticed and will benefit you
- Acknowledge those who helped you
  - Research is *not* a zero-sum game
  - Give credit where credit is due

## Be Open

- Independent intellectually does not mean all-knowing
- [Seek help]{.fragment .highlight-red}
- Be transparent

## Conventions

- No spaces or weird characters in folder and file names
  - [`c'est mon mémoire!.docx`]{.fragment .strike}
  - `PreregDraft_Makowski.docx`
- *CamelCase* vs. *snake_case*
  - Also applies to programming

## Marking Criteria

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}

- **Scientific quality** of the dissertation
  - The closer to a scientific paper the better
  - Show that you read papers beyond what was provided (intro)
  - Show that you understood the results and put them in perspective (discussion)
- **Amount of work** provided
  - Paradigm implementation <sub><sup>*(if applicable)*</sup></sub>
  - Number of participants recruited <sub><sup>*(if applicable*)</sup></sub>
- **Not influenced** by significant results
  - Having found "no significant" effect / hypotheses not proven is absolutely fine!
- **Strongly influenced** by participation/involvement **during the whole year**

:::

## To-do for next meeting

- Onboarding (https://github.com/RealityBending/Onboarding)
  - [x] GitHub basics
  - [x] Add your profile on the lab website
- Install R and R-Studio locally
- Think about projects

<!-- Session 2 -->

## Research Projects {.center}

```{css}
.center h2 {
  text-align: center;
}
```

## 1. Body and Mind

::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}

### Common Paradigm

- Resting State
- Tapping Task
- Heartbeat Counting Task (HCT)
- Interoception questionnaires (MAIA and IAS)
- Primal Beliefs scale

### Subprojects

a. Measuring Interoception: Objective vs. Subjective
b. Measuring Interoception: Tapping Task 
c. Interoception and Primal Beliefs
d. Interoception and HRV (during Resting State)
e. Interoception and HRV (during HCT)

### Notes

- Physiological equipment
- Less flexibility (physical presence, room booking management)

::: 

## 2. Illusion Sensitivity

::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}

### Common Paradigm

- Illusion Sensitivity Task
- Normal and Pathological Personality Scales
- Hypnosis Suggestibility Scale
- Conflict Resolution Task (Flanker Task)

### Subprojects

a. Illusion sensitivity vs. Personality
b. Illusion sensitivity vs. Suggestibility
c. Illusion sensitivity vs. Cognitive Control

### Notes

- More flexible (portable experiment)
- Implement Flanker task (in JsPsych)

::: 


## 3. Fictional Reappraisal

::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}

### Common Paradigm

- Investigate the effects of reality beliefs modulation on emotions related to erotic stimuli
- Conceptualize and build an experiment
- Questionnaires of emotion regulation skills

### Subprojects

- Intraindividual Effects
- Interindividual Correlates

### Notes

- Conceptualization and implementation steps necessary
- Possibly physiological signals (?)
- More work required

::: 

## 4. PHQ-4R

::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}

### Common Paradigm

- PHQ-4: Ultra-brief assessment of Anxiety and Depression
- Testing the benefits of adding a new response option
- 2 groups: original PHQ-4 version vs. revised
- Correlation with other depression/anxiety measures
- Does the revised version improves the correlation for mild mood fluctuations

### Notes

- Flexible
- Research needed on convergent validity for mood disorders assessment

::: 

## Make your Choice

- Questions? Clarifications?
- Pick 2 (first and second choice, from two groups)

## Next Week 

- No lab meeting on Friday, instead...
- JRA Poster session
  - Wednesday 18t, 12-2pm 
  - Woodlands 2 \& 3, Student Centre
